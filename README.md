# SteamTables

A Julia implementation of the IAPWS-IF97 properties of water and steam.
Provides the Gibbs and Helmholtz free energies, enthalpy, entropy, Cp, Cv and sonic velocity.

## Note:
**While there is currently very little activity on this package, that is because it is basically complete. It is in active use by myself and not abandoned. I just don't have any features to add or known bugs to fix, with the possible execption of including Unitful.jl type units, if I ever get round to that.

Support for Julia prior to v1.0.0 is dropped. There is no reason that this
code won't work, but I am not maintaining an old version of Julia to test on.
**


Inputs are either P&T, P&h or P&s.
